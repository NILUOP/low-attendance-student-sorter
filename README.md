<br>
so in this project I made an csv file reader which read student data from csv file like their name, roll no. and attendance percentage. After that it sort out all the student who has low attandance (in this case &lt;80%) and print their data like name and email address separated by comas which is helpful because we can directly copy and paste it in "to" section while writing an email and all the emails comes separetly
<br>
so that we don't have to write all email manually which can save our time
<br>
it can also print name and email address of all student if we want to
